# Perfects.Engineering Website Code

This is still work in progress, but
See designs for the website here: https://github.com/PerfectEngineering/designs/website

## Setup

The website is actually a static website that can be launched directly by opening the index.html in browser. But if you want some of the website request features to work, you would need to run it with a server.

For convenience, a makefile is include and you can run `make serve` and this would serve the website which can be see at `http://localhost:9898`.
